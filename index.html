            <h1>Site Content</h1>
            <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Common_Prayer" target="_blank">1662 Book of Common Prayer</a> remains the offical prayer book of the Church of England.</p>
            <p><em>PrayerBook.online</em> currently contains the liturgy for <a href="./services/The-Lords-Supper-or-Holy-Communion.html">The Lord's Supper or Holy Communion</a>.  Using the <a href="./settings.html">Settings</a>, you can switch the layout of this service between the full authorised version, as present in the printed BCP, and the slightly abridged version, as used in the Parish of South Shoebury.</p>
            <p>Regardless of the version of the service chosen, accessing the service liturgy will automatically insert the relevent collects and scripture readings in the right place in the service.</p>
            <p>As well as the liturgy, <em>PrayerBook.online</em> also contains a dynamic <a href="./calendar.html">Calendar</a> which provides the dates for each week throughout the year, as well as links to the prescribed scripture for that service.</p>
            <h1>History</h1>
            <p>The site owner is a techie clergy spouse, and so <em>PrayerBook.online</em> came about as a programming exercise in response to the weekly ins and outs of navigating the 1662 BCP - both from a clerical and lay point of view (i.e. preparing the service - ranging from ensuring the right readings have been selected to preapre a sermon, to just knowing the right page numbers to turn to).<br>
            Rather than just make a static page, which still needs the readings and collects to be looked up separately, the challenge became to design a site where the current week could be automatically calculated using the formulae found in the Computus, and then the readings and collects injected in the correct locations in the service.<br>
            Adding to the challenge was the fact our training parish used a slightly abridged version of the service, which changes throughout the year depending on the liturical season.
            </p>
            <p>Hopefully all the different criteria have been accounted for...but, like most programming projects and solutions, I have no doubt this will always be a work in progress!</p>
